### What I learned

``html
 I learned how to use the right element to structure this project.
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css psuedo element{
  &:after{
    ...
  }
}
$breakpoints: ("small": 23.5em,"medium": 40em);
@mixin breakpoints($size) {
 @media(min-width: map-get($breakpoints,$size)){
  @content;
  }
}
@include breakpoints(small){
  ...
}
sass partials
```

### Continued development

HTML/CSS/JS/SASS - 
These areas that I want to continue focusing on my future projects and still not completely comfortable with.
